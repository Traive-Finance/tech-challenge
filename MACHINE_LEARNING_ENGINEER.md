# **Traive Challenge - Machine Learning Engineer**

### **Overview**
Below, we have outlined a problem where you will design and develop a machine learning solution to meet specific requirements. This is your opportunity to showcase your expertise! We will be assessing how you structure your project, organize your code, and apply ML concepts, best practices, and technologies to deliver a robust solution.

### **Problem Statement**
You will create a **Machine Learning Solution** in the agricultural finance domain, with a focus on end-to-end implementation from data processing to API deployment. You may choose to solve any relevant problem, such as:
- Credit risk assessment for farms
- Crop yield prediction
- Agricultural commodity price forecasting
- Farm productivity analysis

The solution should demonstrate your ability to handle data, train models, and deploy them in a production-ready manner.

### **Requirements**
The solution should support the following capabilities:

1. **Data and Model Development**
   - Clear problem definition and dataset selection
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model training and validation
   - Performance metrics and evaluation

2. **API Development**
   - REST API implementation using Python (FastAPI recommended)
   - Endpoint(s) for model inference
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Clear API documentation

3. **Deployment Ready**
   - Containerization using Docker
   - Environment configuration using `.env` or equivalent
   - Clear setup and run instructions

### **Deliverables**
- A fully functional ML solution that meets the requirements
- Jupyter notebooks documenting your analysis and modeling process
- A clear and organized project structure that adheres to best practices for ML development
  - Use of modular, well-documented code
  - Separation of concerns
  - Requirements.txt

### **Stretch Goals**
The following are not required but will be considered a plus:

- **Code Reliability**
  - Unit tests for critical components
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - Model validation tests

- **Production-Readiness**
  - Proper logging for debugging and monitoring
  - Model performance monitoring
  - Input data validation and error handling
  - Best practices for ML in production

- **Documentation**
  - Project Overview
  - Model documentation:
    - Problem definition
    - Dataset details
    - Model architecture
    - Performance metrics
  - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
  - Setup and deployment instructions
  - Example usage

## **Submission Guidelines**
Include all source code and documentation in a publicly available git repository(github preferred!) and send it to us. We'll review it as soon as possible and get back to you!

_P.S.: For discretion reasons, please avoid including `Traive` anywhere in your challenge!_
